# Speakify (aka getPronunciation)
Speakify uses the soundoftext API (https://github.com/ncpierson/soundoftext-api) in order to access Google's text-to-speech functionality.
Speakify lets you upload a list of words in CSV format and will download the corresponding pronunciations in mp3 format.

The files are saved in the same folder containing the app files in a subfolder named after the CSV file used.
